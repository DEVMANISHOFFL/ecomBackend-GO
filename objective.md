Great question 👍 — thinking in terms of production-grade features is exactly how you’ll stand out when building your e-commerce backend in Go.

Here’s a breakdown of what a production-grade Amazon-like backend typically has, and what you can implement step by step:

🔑 Core CRUD Features (MVP – you already started ✅)

Products CRUD → create, read, update, delete products.

Users → signup, login, authentication (JWT/Session).

Cart → add/remove/update items.

Orders → place orders from cart, track status.

Payments → integration with Stripe/Razorpay (or mock for learning).

🏗️ Production-Grade Additions
1. Authentication & Security

Role-based access (admin vs customer).

Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2).

Refresh tokens / session management.

Middleware for authorization (only admins can add products).

Rate limiting / brute force protection.

2. Database Layer

Migrations (using golang-migrate or goose).

Use PostgreSQL (for relational data) + Redis (for caching sessions/carts).

Optimized queries (indexes, pagination).

3. Scalability & Performance

Caching: Redis for product listings, frequently accessed data.

Background jobs/queues: e.g., sending order confirmation emails.

Webhooks: Stripe/Razorpay payment success callback.

Async processing (like email sending, stock updates).

4. Search & Filters

Full-text search on products.

Filters (price, category, rating).

Pagination for product listing.

5. File Handling

Product images upload (store in AWS S3 / GCP Bucket / local FS in dev).

Image optimization & CDN delivery.

6. Admin Panel (Backend Features)

CRUD for products, categories, discounts.

View orders & update status (Pending → Shipped → Delivered).

User management (ban/unban, reset password).

7. Payments & Order Flow

Integrate payment gateway (Stripe, Razorpay).

Order lifecycle:

Cart → Checkout → Payment → Order → Invoice.

Refunds/cancellations (mock flows are enough for portfolio).

8. Testing & CI/CD

Unit tests for controllers & services.

Integration tests with DB.

GitHub Actions / GitLab CI pipeline for linting, testing, and building Docker images.

9. Deployment & Infra

Docker + docker-compose for local dev.

Config management (.env, config package).

Deploy to Render / Railway / AWS (show real deployment in portfolio).

Logging (structured logs with zap or logrus).

Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana, or OpenTelemetry for tracing).

🚀 Final Touch (to impress recruiters)

Write API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).

Add Postman Collection for demo.

Deploy live (Heroku/Render/AWS) and link it in your portfolio.

Show architecture diagram + DB schema in README.

👉 If you build even 50-60% of this list, you’ll have a production-like e-commerce backend that hiring managers will immediately recognize as "job-ready".

Would you like me to design a step-by-step roadmap (Week 1 → Week 2 → Week 3) for building this e-commerce backend in Go so you can stay consistent and land a job?
